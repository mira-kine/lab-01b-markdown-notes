# Day 1: Developer Tools

Important tools I learned today:

* ACP = add connect push
* making links using [ ] and ( )
* **ls -al** will show files that are hidden as well

A cool thing I learned is how to show inline code and changing written format according to what kind of code I am using.

### _For Example:_

This is how I show `console.log()`

If I want to show a block of text, that would look like:

```js
const () {
    console.log()
}
```

typing "js" after the backwards ticks ` will keep the color coding to what it is in js
